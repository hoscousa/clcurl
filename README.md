# clcurl
A port of Curl.java, made to run on GPU.

##building

Make a directory `build`, change to that directory, and run 

```
cmake ..
```

That will generate the necessary makefiles. Then, you will need to run `make` or `make -C build`, depending on wether or not you are in the parent directory.
